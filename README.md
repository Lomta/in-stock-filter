Ok so hear me out

You finally finished that one assignment/midterm/project and it's time to [TREAT YO SEEEEELF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSjM5B3QNlw).
You are still a pretty broke second year uni student, so you open the sales page of one of your fave stores and see all these cool stuff. You get so excited.
Like you already can imagine your self in that Hello Kitty jumpsuit. You click the item to check out its page and do the cart. AND BOOM. THEY DON"T HAVE YOUR SIIIIIIZEEE. 
*SCREAMING INTERNALLY*. 

If I had a dollar for every time this happened to me... (I'd probably not need to open the sales section :')

So I just wrote a small python script(used BeautifulSoup) to scrape data from their website and then find the urls to the items that have my size in stock.
NO MORE DISAPPOINTMENTS. 

p.s this project is a result of having a cup of coffe at 8 pm.
p.s.s If I'm being honest, it was two cups. :' )
